# Privacy Policy for Compressor

**Last updated:** January 26, 2026

**Compressor** ("the App") is designed with privacy as its core principle.

## 1. Data Collection
The App **does not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, usage data, or metadata. 

## 2. Permissions
The App operates with **zero** invasive permissions:
*   **No Internet Access:** The App does not request the `INTERNET` permission. It is technically impossible for the App to send data to a remote server.
*   **No Storage Scanning:** The App uses the Android System Photo Picker. It only has access to the specific video files you explicitly select for compression. It cannot read your other files.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App contains **no** third-party tracking, analytics, or advertising SDKs (such as Google Analytics, Firebase, or AdMob).

## 4. Local Processing
All video compression is performed locally on your device using the Android hardware acceleration capabilities. Your videos never leave your device.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JoshAtticus/Compressor) or send an email to compressor@joshattic.us.
