<b>Compressor</b> is a lightning fast, ad free, super lightweight native video compressor

Unlike other apps that use slow, bulky, old versions of FFmpeg with software encoding, Compressor uses Android's native <b>Media3 Hardware Acceleration</b> to process video faster than any other app.


<b>Features:</b>

- Faster than every single compression app on the Play Store. Period.
- Uses native Media3 library, not another slow, bulky FFMpeg wrapper
- No third party libraries
- No invasive permissions (no storage, no internet etc)
- Ad free
- Super lightweight (< 10MB)
- Completely native Kotlin (no React Native slop here)
- Simple, clean UI
- Works on Android 7.0 and up (Galaxy S6, Pixel 1, Nexus 5X, Moto G4 etc).


<b>Why does this exist?</b>

Most compressors are wrappers around old software filled with ads. Compressor is written in 100% Kotlin, designed to be the cleanest, fastest tool for the job.
