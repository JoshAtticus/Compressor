Compressor 1.2.0 adds new features:

- New dedicated tablet UI for enhanced usability in landscape mode
- Target size presets higher than the original video size are now hidden
- Quality presets no longer upscale videos (resulting in a larger than needed file with worse quality)
- Incompatible video codecs are now handled gracefully
- Removed `ACCESSS_NETWORK_STATE` permission added by a library
