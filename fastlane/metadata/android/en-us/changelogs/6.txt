Compressor 1.1.1 is a bug fix release:

- Prevent original videos from being indefinitely stored in cache by clearing cache once finished compressing
- Fix storage saved counter not updating until app is restarted
- Fix storage saved counter only showing storage saved from last compressed video
- 60fps can no longer be selected as a framerate for videos with less than 60fps original framerate
- Estimated final storage is now calculated more accurately
